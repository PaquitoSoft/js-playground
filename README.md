=============

This is a simple app implementing a basic shopping cart.
There is a static server (written in nodeJS) to allow browser ajax requests (products data).

The idea is to implement this tiny functionality with several JS frameworks to get dirty with them and also compare them.
These are the ones I'm expecting to try:

  + Vanilla: Done! (simple approach helped by jQuery)
  + [Backbone](http://backbonejs.org/): Not available yet
  + [Angular](http://angularjs.org): Not available yet
  + [Spine](http://spinejs.com/): Not available yet
  + [Ember](http://emberjs.com/): Not available yet
